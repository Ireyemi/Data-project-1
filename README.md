## (No-show appointments data analysis)

## by (Ireyemi Stephen)



## Dataset

The dataset I investigated and analysed is the NO-SHOW APPOINTMENTS dataset. It is a dataset that contains information of patients in Brazil that scheduled for medical appointment(s) and whether or not they showed up for their scheduled appointment. There are 14 associated variables in this dataset which will help me to conduct an appropraite investigation.

The description of the some of the associated variables include:

Schedule day : the day the patient schedules for medical appointment.

Neighbourhood : this indicates the location of the hospital for the scheduled appointment.

Age: age of the patient for the medical appointment.

Scholarship: this indicates whether or not a patient got into the Bolza family program.

No-show : NO means the patient showed up for the appointment ; YES means the patient did not show up for the appointment.

*For the variables with binary values (0 and 1) : O means NO/NEGATIVE ; 1 means YES/POSITIVE

Bolsa Familia was a social welfare program run by the Brazilian government that was a part of the Fome Zero system of federal aid initiatives. Poor Brazilian families received financial aid from Bolsa Familia. Families had to make sure their children went to school and received their vaccinations in order to qualify.They were withdrawn from the program and had their funding suspended if they went over the permitted number of absences from school.




## Summary of Findings


1. The majority of people (80 %) usually show up to scheduled appointment.

2. Females go to the doctor more often than males - 65% of females but 35 % of males.

3. With regards to gender there is no difference in the show up rate to appointment.

4. Among the people scheduled appointment, hypertension is the most common disease - almost 20% are affected by hypertension.

5. Suffering from hypertension or diabetes is asscoiated with slightly higher appointment show rate.
